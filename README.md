# ðŸ™‚ Currency Converter ðŸ’µðŸ“ˆ

<p>
    This is a windows forms application written in C#. <br> I used the free ExchangeRate-API to get global currency rates and codes for my app. The user can pick which base and target currencies they want for a input amount, then the converted dollar amount is displayed at the bottom. <br>To use this on your local environment, all you will need is your own API key which you can get for free by signing up at 
    [ExchangeRate-API Site]("https://www.exchangerate-api.com") <br>
    my awesome demo:
